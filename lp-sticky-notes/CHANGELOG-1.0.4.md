# Changelog v1.0.4
**Release Date:** 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Button Size "Small" was showing as oval instead of circle
- Sticky button was overlapping the LearnPress "Next" button on mobile — added "Button Bottom Offset (px)" setting in Appearance to adjust position

### Added
- "View Full" button in shortcode `[lp_sticky_notes]` to expand/collapse long notes
- "Export PDF" button in the "View All Notes" popup — exports your notes as a PDF file named `mynotes-{username}-{domain}.pdf`
