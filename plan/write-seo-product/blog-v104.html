    <h1>From Scattered Thoughts to Organized Success: What’s New in LearnPress Sticky Notes Update v1.0.4</h1>

    <p>Imagine this scenario: You are deep into a 20-module masterclass. You have taken dozens of digital notes.
        However, when it comes time to implement your new skills, you cannot find that one crucial piece of advice.
        This is a common frustration for modern students. This is exactly where the <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes
            Update</strong> version 1.0.4 steps in to save the day.</p>

    <p>In the digital age, note-taking should be more than just typing. It should be about retaining and utilizing
        information. Our latest update focuses on portability, clarity, and a seamless mobile experience. Whether
        you are a course creator or a student, this update will redefine how you interact with LearnPress content.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>“The goal of education is not the knowledge, but the action. Our Sticky Notes are the bridge to that
            action.” – The Mamflow Team</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>At Mamflow, we believe learning should be friction-less. Therefore, the <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes
            Update</strong> in version 1.0.4 is designed to bridge the gap between taking notes and actually using
        them. Let's explore how these changes empower your students.</p>

    <h2>Your Course Insights, Now Portable: The "Export PDF" Revolution</h2>
    <p>The <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong> version 1.0.4 brings the most requested feature: PDF
        Export. While digital notes are convenient, many learners still prefer the tangibility of paper or the
        permanence of a PDF document. Consequently, we have made it possible to take your notes anywhere.</p>

    <!-- Image Placeholder -->
    <p><i>[Image: Screenshot showing the new Export PDF button in the View All Notes popup. Alt Text: LearnPress
            Sticky Notes Update v1.0.4 PDF Export Feature]</i></p>

    <p>By clicking the "Export PDF" button, students can generate a document containing all their notes for a
        specific course. The file is automatically named <code>mynotes-{username}-{domain}.pdf</code>. This ensures
        that every export is unique and easy to identify. Furthermore, the layout is clean and professional, making
        it perfect for physical printing or digital archiving.</p>

    <p>Why is this important for <strong>LearnPress Student Productivity</strong>? Studies show that reviewing notes
        in different formats can enhance memory retention. By offering a PDF option, you are giving your students a
        powerful tool for success. Additionally, it adds a premium feel to your LMS platform.</p>

    <h2>Never Miss a Detail with "View Full"</h2>
    <p>Some notes are short reminders, while others are long observations. Previously, reading long notes in the
        sticky view could feel cramped. In this <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong>, we have introduced
        the "View Full" button. This toggle is available within the `[lp_sticky_notes]` shortcode.</p>

    <p>When a student clicks "View Full," the note expands to reveal the entire content. Once they are finished
        reading, they can easily collapse it back. This ensures that the student dashboard remains clean and
        organized. It is all about balance—providing enough space for deep thoughts without cluttering the user
        interface.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Intelligent Toggling:</strong> Switch between summary and full view instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> No more scrolling inside tiny boxes.</li>
        <li><strong>UI Cleanliness:</strong> Keep the dashboard focused on what matters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Polished Experience on Every Device</h2>
    <p>We know that many students learn on the go. However, mobile screens are small and precious. In previous
        versions, the sticky button sometimes overlapped critical navigation elements, such as the LearnPress "Next"
        button. We fixed this in the latest <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong>.</p>

    <p>We have added a new "Button Bottom Offset (px)" setting in the Appearance menu. This allows site owners to
        precisely position the sticky button. Whether you need it 20px or 100px from the bottom, you now have the
        control. This ensures a <strong>LearnPress Mobile UX Fix</strong> that works for every theme.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we perfected the "Small" button size. Previously, it could appear slightly oval on certain
        browsers. Now, it is a perfectly sharp circle. While it might seem like a small detail, aesthetic perfection
        leads to higher user trust and engagement. A professional site needs professional tools.</p>
