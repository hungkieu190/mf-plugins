<h1>From Scattered Thoughts to Organized Success: What’s New in LearnPress Sticky Notes Update v1.0.4</h1>

<p>Imagine this scenario: You are deep into a 20-module masterclass. You have taken dozens of digital notes. However,
    when it comes time to implement your new skills, you cannot find that one crucial piece of advice. This is a common
    frustration for modern students. This is exactly where the <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong> version
    1.0.4 steps in to save the day.</p>

<p>In the digital age, note-taking should be more than just typing. It should be about retaining and utilizing
    information. Our latest update focuses on portability, clarity, and a seamless mobile experience. Whether you are a
    course creator or a student, this update will redefine how you interact with LearnPress content.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“The goal of education is not the knowledge, but the action. Our Sticky Notes are the bridge to that action.” –
        The Mamflow Team</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Mamflow, we believe learning should be friction-less. Therefore, the <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes
        Update</strong> in version 1.0.4 is designed to bridge the gap between taking notes and actually using them.
    Let's explore how these changes empower your students.</p>

<h2>Your Course Insights, Now Portable: The "Export PDF" Revolution</h2>

<p>The <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong> version 1.0.4 brings the most requested feature: PDF Export.
    While digital notes are convenient, many learners still prefer the tangibility of paper or the permanence of a PDF
    document. Consequently, we have made it possible to take your notes anywhere.</p>

<p><i>[Image: Screenshot showing the new Export PDF button in the View All Notes popup. Alt Text: LearnPress Sticky
        Notes Update v1.0.4 PDF Export Feature]</i></p>

<p>By clicking the "Export PDF" button, students can generate a document containing all their notes for a specific
    course. The file is automatically named <code>mynotes-{username}-{domain}.pdf</code>. This ensures that every export
    is unique and easy to identify. Furthermore, the layout is clean and professional, making it perfect for physical
    printing or digital archiving.</p>

<p>Why is this important for <strong>LearnPress Student Productivity</strong>? Studies show that reviewing notes in
    different formats can enhance memory retention. By offering a PDF option, you are giving your students a powerful
    tool for success. Additionally, it adds a premium feel to your LMS platform.</p>

<h2>Never Miss a Detail with "View Full"</h2>

<p>Some notes are short reminders, while others are long observations. Previously, reading long notes in the sticky view
    could feel cramped. In this <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong>, we have introduced the "View Full"
    button. This toggle is available within the `[lp_sticky_notes]` shortcode.</p>

<p>When a student clicks "View Full," the note expands to reveal the entire content. Once they are finished reading,
    they can easily collapse it back. This ensures that the student dashboard remains clean and organized. It is all
    about balance—providing enough space for deep thoughts without cluttering the user interface.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Intelligent Toggling:</strong> Switch between summary and full view instantly.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> No more scrolling inside tiny boxes.</li>
    <li><strong>UI Cleanliness:</strong> Keep the dashboard focused on what matters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Polished Experience on Every Device</h2>

<p>We know that many students learn on the go. However, mobile screens are small and precious. In previous versions, the
    sticky button sometimes overlapped critical navigation elements, such as the LearnPress "Next" button. We fixed this
    in the latest <strong>LearnPress Sticky Notes Update</strong>.</p>

<p>We have added a new "Button Bottom Offset (px)" setting in the Appearance menu. This allows site owners to precisely
    position the sticky button. Whether you need it 20px or 100px from the bottom, you now have the control. This
    ensures a <strong>LearnPress Mobile UX Fix</strong> that works for every theme.</p>

<p>Additionally, we perfected the "Small" button size. Previously, it could appear slightly oval on certain browsers.
    Now, it is a perfectly sharp circle. While it might seem like a small detail, aesthetic perfection leads to higher
    user trust and engagement. A professional site needs professional tools.</p>
